<h1>CFRP Heatmap</h1>

<p>This visualization tool gives a general summary of how many tickets were sold on a given evening, according to the Comédie-Française Registers project. It shows color scale (blue = few tickets sold, red = many tickets sold) on a rendered theater map, according to a season’s average income for each seating category.</p>

<p>The indication thus gives a sense of how crowded each seating category was. However, some categories like the “loges” were rented for the whole season and therefore this income does not show in the registers data. </p>

<p>The division of the audience in the theater is based on the latest scientific information of theater seating plans. The tool is a work in progress, though, as there are instances where the seating category data is unclear.</p>
